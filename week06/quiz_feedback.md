# Week 4 Feedback
Like your weekly assignments, your feedback on this quiz is provided as `quiz_feedback.md` in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.

A big reason for doing this quiz during class was to see what you are able to do one your own without talking to other students. I gave clear instructions that you were NOT to collaborate with others and that the work you submit was to be your own.  If you used ChatGPT or another resource and clearly copied and pasted that work, you will lose all of the points for the first part of this quiz.
